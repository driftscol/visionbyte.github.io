        <h1>HOW TO MAKE AN OMELETTE</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>BEAT THE EGGS: Use two or three eggs per omelette, depending on how hungry you are. Beat the eggs lightly with a fork.</li>
            <li>MELT THE BUTTER: Use an 8-inch non-stick pan for a 2-egg omelette, a 9-inch pan for 3 eggs. Melt the butter over medium-low heat, and keep the temperature low and slow when cooking the eggs so the bottom doesn't get too brown or overcooked.</li>
            <li>ADD THE EGGS: Let the eggs sit for a minute, then use a spoon or spatula to gently lift the cooked eggs from the edges of the pan.</li>
            <li>ADD SPICES: Add salt, pepper, and chili powder, or your own personal preference. Cook for another 30 seconds - 1 minute.</li>
            <li>FOLD AND SERVE: Fold the omelette in half. Slide it onto a plate with the help of a spatula or spoon.</li>
        </ol>
